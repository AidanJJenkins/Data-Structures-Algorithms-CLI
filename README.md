# Data Structures & Algorithms CLI

- This is a work in progress (broken), as of August 21, 2023.
- Some of the current tests will also be updated and/or changed.
  
- Do not change anything in 'template'.
- Run 'go run main.go gen' to generate a new directory with incomplete implementations of important data structures and algorithms.
- Inside the new directroy are sub directories, each with their own topic to practice and test.
- Work in the files with a suffix of 'Prac', when you are done, you can run 'go test' in the sub directory you are in to check if your work is correct
