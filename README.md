# Data Structures & Algorithms CLI

- Do not change anything in 'template'.
- Run 'go run main.go gen' to generate a new directory with incomplete implementations of important data structures and algorithms.
- Run 'go run main.go gen -g <_> to generate just one of the groups, the options for groups are 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    - 1: linear search, binary search, singly linked list, stack, queue, and bubblesort
    - 2: quicksort, reversing singly linked list, doubly linked list, pre/in/post order traversal of a binary tree
    - 3: binary search tree,breadth first search of a binary search tree, comparing trees, depth first search of binary search tree, and prioity queue
    - 4: lru cache, breadth first search of adj matrix, depth first search of adj list, trie tree, and dijkstras shortest path

- Work in the files with a suffix of 'Prac', when you are done, you can run 'go test' in the sub directory you are in to check if your work is correct
