# dsa
- this is a tool to practice data structures and algorithms in go.

- run 'go run main.go gen' to generate a new directory with incomplete implementations of important data structures and algorithms.

- inside the new directroy are sub directories, each with their own topic and related test file.
- once you have written your code in the file with a suffix of 'Prac', you can run 'go test' in the sub directory you are in to check if your work is correct.

- this is incomplete as of August 16, 2023. implementations for heap (priority queue), graphs, and tries, will be added asap.
- some of the current tests will also be updated.
