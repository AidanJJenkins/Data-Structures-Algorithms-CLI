# dsa
- This is a tool to practice data structures and algorithms in go.

- Do not change anything in 'template'.
- Run 'go run main.go gen' to generate a new directory with incomplete implementations of important data structures and algorithms.

- Inside the new directroy are sub directories, each with their own topic and related test file.
- Once you have written your code in the file with a suffix of 'Prac', you can run 'go test' in the sub directory you are in to check if your work is correct.

- This is incomplete as of August 16, 2023. Implementations for heap (priority queue), graphs, and tries, will be added asap.
- Some of the current tests will also be updated.
