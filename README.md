# dsa

- This is a work in progress, as of August 17, 2023 it is incomplete. Implementations for heap, graphs, and tries, will be added asap.
- Some of the current tests will also be updated and/or changed.

- This is a tool to practice data structures and algorithms in go.

- Do not change anything in 'template'.
- Run 'go run main.go gen' to generate a new directory with incomplete implementations of important data structures and algorithms.

- Inside the new directroy are sub directories, each with their own topic to learn, practice and test.
- Work in the files with a suffix of 'Prac', when you are done, you can run 'go test' in the sub directory you are in to check if your work is correct
