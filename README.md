# Data Structures & Algorithms CLI

- Do not change anything in 'template'.
- Run 'go run main.go gen' to generate a new directory with incomplete implementations of important data structures and algorithms.
- Run 'go run main.go group -g <g_> to generate just one of the groups, the options for groups are g1, g2, g3, and g4.
    - g1: linear search, binary search, singly linked list, stack, queue, and bubblesort
    - g2: quicksort, reversing singly linked list, doubly linked list, in/pre/post order traversal of a binary tree
    - g3: binary search tree,breadth first search of a binary search tree, comparing trees, depth first search of binary search tree, and prioity queue
    - g4: lru cache, breadth first search of adj matrix (more will be added, and current tests will change)

- Work in the files with a suffix of 'Prac', when you are done, you can run 'go test' in the sub directory you are in to check if your work is correct
